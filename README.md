#WooCommerce Coupon Based on "Abbonamento" ##User Meta

This repository contains an example of how to restrict the usage of a WooCommerce coupon to users who have a custom user field named abbonamento set to true.

##Installation

Copy the code from functions.php into your active theme's functions.php file or into your custom plugin.
Go to a user's profile edit page in the WordPress backend. You will see a new checkbox field called "Abbonamento" under the "Extra Information" section.
Check the "Abbonamento" checkbox for a user to allow them to use the coupon.
Usage

When a user tries to apply a coupon, the system checks if the "Abbonamento" field is checked for the user's profile. If it is not checked, the user will receive an error message and the coupon will not be applied.
